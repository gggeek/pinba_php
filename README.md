Polyfill-Pinba
==============

Pure-php reimplementation of the "PHP extension for Pinba"

See http://pinba.org for the original

Includes code from the Protobuf for PHP lib by Iv√°n -DrSlump- Montes: https://github.com/drslump/Protobuf-PHP

Other known packages implementing the same idea: https://github.com/vearutop/pinba-pure-php

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

## Compatibility

We strive to implement the same API as Pinba extension v 1.1.2.

As for the server side, the library is tested both against a Pinba server and a Pinba2 one.

Known issues:
- the time reported for page execution will be much shorter with any php code than it can be measured with a php extension
- other: many... (to be documented)

## Requirements

PHP 5.3 or any later version.

A Pinba server to send the data to. Known servers include http://pinba.org/ and https://github.com/badoo/pinba2. Both
are available as Docker Container images for trying out.
